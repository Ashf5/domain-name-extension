# Link Domain Interceptor

**Link Domain Interceptor** is a Chrome extension that helps protect users from phishing and suspicious links in webmail services. When you click a link in your email, the extension displays a popup showing the destination domain and gives you the option to follow the link or cancel, helping you avoid scams and malicious redirects.

## Features

- **Domain Preview:** See the real domain before following any email link.
- **Security Check:** Quick access to a security report for the destination domain.
- **User Control:** Choose to follow the link or cancel with a single click.
- **Smart Positioning:** Popup appears near your click and stays within the visible area.
- **Supports Major Email Providers:** Works on Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail, ProtonMail, AOL, Zoho, Fastmail, Yandex, and GMX.

- The extension injects a content script into supported email sites.
- When you click a link, it intercepts the click, extracts the real destination (even through common redirect patterns), and displays a popup with the domain.
- You decide whether to continue or cancel.

## Development

- All main logic is in `content.js`.
- Styling is in `style.css`.
- Domain parsing uses [`psl.min.js`](https://github.com/lupomontero/psl).
